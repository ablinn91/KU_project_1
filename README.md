Group project one, focusing on athletic events vs world data

We, a group of five, used datasets from Kaggle that provided 100 Years of Olympic Data and the World Marathon Majors. Our interest was in establishing an analysis of the dominance of African countries in the Marathon and finding the relationship between the country's GDP Vs Olympic performance Vs Marathon Wins Vs Weather, Environment and Demographics.
